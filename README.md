This is a sample website for HBH. It uses React.js.

It uses the United States Food and Drug Administration's openFDA API to get drug reaction information for a selected drug.

It uses font awesome for the icons.

The "Set Reminder" button actually is the button to make the endpoint call to the FDA site to get the drug reaction information. For example, type "Allegra" and then hit the blue button. The information appears at the bottom of the screen.

My comments 


Some more things that I would add if this were real:


1. It needs more medical warning information. This is from a legal prespective. Checboxes, pop-ups and stuff to get the patient's permission and signature in case someone sues.

2. "Welcome to Honeybee Health." I would have this be a link to the front page.

3. "Sign up for reminder emails!" This top text would instead be a link to either the user's own page to sign up for emails, or a form to sign up for emails. I suppose it depends if the user has a page in this site.

4. Links to WebMD or to the manufacturer's website. To give the patients more information.

5. I would have a button to actually do a search from the API.

6. Make the results of the search a different color and size to highlight the importance.
