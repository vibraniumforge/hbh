Some more things that I would add if this were real:


1. Definately more medical warning information. This is from a legal prespective. Checboxes, pop-ups and stuff to get the patient's permission and signature in case someone sues.

2. "Welcome to Honeybee Health" I would have this be a link to the front page.

3. "Sign up for reminder emails!" This top text would instead be a link to either the user's own page to sign up for emails, or a form to sign up for emails. I suppose it depends if the user has a page in this site.

4. Links to WebMD or the manufacturer's site. To give the patients more information.
